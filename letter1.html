            <p>Haven't seen you for a few days and really miss you. This is what I wanted to share with you the evening when you gave the letter:</p>
            <p>
                We had a surprise party for a dad-to-be on Core team at work. He said he was very happy and nervous about becoming a dad. He cut the cake very carefully because he tried to avoid cutting the little shoe candies on the cake. He took so many photos with the wall decorations too. Then I realized that he will probably share this experience with his wife after work. I looked at him and think that one day you will have a dad-to-be party at your office as well. I started to picture how you will share the experience with me when you come back home. Then I noticed I have tears in my eyes, I tried hard to hold them back and didn’t want my colleagues to see me crying.

                I know we’ve been through lots of difficult times recently. And because of these difficulties, I got emotional and sensitive, but at the same time I believe after we get through this, we will understand each other deeper.
                This is the first time we get into a situation this tough and both of us feel the pain. I really want to overcome all of these challenges with you. Life might not be easy, we might face other difficulties, but I want to go through the journey with you. I'm sure we will laugh at these experience when we get old.
            </p>

                You said that we have very different personalities. That's true, but that’s also what I like about you. I think different personalities could help us expand our lives in a way that we've never expected before. And I appreciate all the things you brought into my life. I really enjoyed playing board games with your friends and cousins and I've never expected that before I met you. And I guess you probably didn't expect our day trip to Art Omi would be so fun and unforgettable.

                I look forward to creating more memories for us ❤️

                I had lunch with a colleague today and she said she will go to Germany next week for her best friend’s wedding. She said the groom is from Germany and the bride is from California. They had a long distance relationship during their twenties and flew to see each other every few months. A few years ago the bride moved to Germany and started to learn German, and now she built a life there. My colleague said “these are the crazy things people do for love”. This was another time I have to hold back my tears at work.

                I felt so lucky that I asked this designer for lunch and heard this story.

                I believed that moving to China for one year or two could be a positive adventure for us while we are young. Even though there were concerns, I believed by the end it would be a challenging yet enjoyable experience. That’s why I was trying so hard to make it happen. But I think I wasn’t able to dismiss your concerns well enough and I definitely underestimated the pressure you had in the past 1.5 months.

                After hearing the story, I feel neither of us has done enough for our love. I haven’t done enough “crazy” things for our love yet. I won’t accept that we will get separated without even trying to fix the problems we have. Sharing experience with you is more important than anything else. Those cool experience are not cool if I have to do without you. ❤️
